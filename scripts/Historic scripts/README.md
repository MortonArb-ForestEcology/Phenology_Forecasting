# Historic scripts README

This is a repository for old scripts. Most are not documented as of right now

## OLD_Frequentist GDD5-burst.R

Purpose: To use arb weather data and phenology monitoring data to create a predicitve model of bud burst timing
         This script serves as the Frequentist model which will largely be for testing/comparison
         
Inputs: dat.comb dataframe that is created by the Organize_Data_Pheno.R script

Outputs: Currently, a hindcast of a species modeled day of budburst vs observed date of budburst

Notes: This is now a retired old script from when we used this as a comparision
